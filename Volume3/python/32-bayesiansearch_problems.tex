Write a function that accepts two $20 \times 20$ arrays, $p$ and $q$, and returns the index pair $i,j$ of the next search location.

Write a function that accepts two $20 \times 20$ arrays, $p$ and $q$, as well as an index pair $i,j$ of search coordinates for the most recent unsuccessful search, and returns the posterior probabilities $\tilde{p}_{k,l}$ for each possible location $k,l$, where $1 \leq k,l \leq 20$.

Write a function to simulate the search procedure. It should accept two $20 \times 20$ arrays, $p$ and $q$, where $p$ is our initial prior on the location of the vessel and $q$ contains the probability of success for each grid location. It should also accept the actual location $i,j$ of the vessel. During the simulation process, assume that $q$ is correct, i.e. given that we search in location $i,j$, we will successfully find the vessel with probability $q_{i,j}$. The function should return the number of search iterations until success, as well as the location of the vessel (but don't hard code this!).

Unpickle the two files mentioned above, and test your previous function. Once it's working properly, write a function that runs the previous function $n\_sim$ times, and prints out the shortest search length, longest search length, and average search length. Test it with $n\_sim = 500$ at locations $9, 10$ and $12, 5$.

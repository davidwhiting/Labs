Unpickle the file \texttt{homicides}, which contains the approximate longitude (first column) and latitude (second column) of a homicide in Baltimore. Train a $3$-component GMM on this data set.

Compute the density at each point on a sufficiently fine grid of the Baltimore region. Save a plot of this pdf.

Using \li{stats.gaussian\_kde}, initialize a KDE with the homicide data (make sure it's in the right format!), and compute the KDE of each point on your grid of Baltimore. Plot the density and save your plot.

Find this $95\%$ region for both the GMM and the KDE and plot it using \li{imshow}, where each ``safe'' point on the grid is $0$ and each ``unsafe'' region is $1$.
%these final plots are included in the folder with the lab.

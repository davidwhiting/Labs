Load the digits data and separate it into a training set and a test set.

Find and read some of the documentation for the aforementioned class. Implement a KNN classifier on the training set. What is the misclassification rate on your test set?

Predict the values for the test set using the SVM we just trained. What is your misclassification rate? How does the SVM's performance compare to the KNN classifier?

Separate the data set into training data and test data. Create a PCA object fit to the training data. With this object, reduce the dimensionality of both the training data and the test data.

Train an SVM on the image set with the same parameter grid search used above. Label the test data. What is your misclassification rate?

Train a KNN classifier on the image data set. What is your misclassification rate on the test data? Does this surprise you?

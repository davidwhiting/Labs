Write a function that computes the $k$-neighborhood of a sample 
$\mathbf{x}$ given $k$ and a training set. Assume the use of the Euclidean metric.

Write a function that labels a new sample $\mathbf{x}$ given $k$ and a training set. Assume the use of the Euclidean metric.

Write a KNN class which accepts initial training data and training labels. 
It should have a method to classify new samples, given a value of $k$. 
Load the iris dataset from \li{sklearn.datasets}, and by separating the data into training and testing sets, 
implement your class. Test your classifier on the test data given different values of $k$. 
What are the misclassification rates?

Write an SVM class. Upon initialization, it should accept a training data set and training target set.
It should have a method called \texttt{setKernel} which accepts one of the three kernel types, 
and defines a kernel function for the object. It should also have a method to train the classifier, 
and another method to predict the class of a new sample. 
It should predict $1$ if $f(\mathbf{x}) > 0$ and $-1$ if $f(\mathbf{x}) < 0$.

Load the data set. Separate it into a training set and a test set. 
Train SVMs on the data, trying each kernel with various parameter values. What are your misclassification rates?
